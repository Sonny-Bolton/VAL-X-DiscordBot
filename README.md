🛠️ Development Process

Val-X was developed by using Python with Visual Studio Code as the primary development environment. This bot was built to use Discord slash commands for easy use for both developers and community members. Every feature was designed to reflect my studios workflow, such as scheduling playtests, collecting structured feedback, and highlighting community contributions. 

📚 What I Learned

While building Val-X, I learned how to design and structure a business-oriented Discord bot that supports studio communication and community management. I gained experience creating scalable command systems, organizing multiple bot features around a clear purpose, and building tools that bridge the gap between developers and players. This project improved my understanding of how Discord can be used as a professional platform for game development and community-driven feedback.

🎯 How It Can Be Used

Val-X is used by my game studio to manage playtests, communicate updates, collect feedback, and engage their community in a more structured way. It is ideal for indie studios, development teams, or any project that relies on Discord as a central hub for collaboration and player interaction.
